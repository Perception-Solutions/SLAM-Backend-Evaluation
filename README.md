# SLAMBackendAlgos

A Project for benchmarking existing SLAM algorithms on planes dataset. 
Benchmarking is done on an example of two TUM datasets: 
office and living room with respect to given ground truth trajectories. An aim of the project is to evaluate ate and rpe
errors on both pre-annotated and frontend processed datasets, find key differences in the results and give minimum 
requirements to the frontend algorithm.
